# Jest-API-Tests

## Description: 
Jest-API-Tests is a testing framework designed to validate API endpoints against a local 
[mock-server](https://github.com/JReyes11/mock-server) powered by json-server. This project provides a lightweight and efficient way to perform API testing using Jest, ensuring consistent responses without relying on a live backend. Ideal for test automation, it enables fast, isolated, and repeatable API validation.
